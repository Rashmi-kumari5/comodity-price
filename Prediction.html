                    <h2>Factors Influencing Dollar Index</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interest Rates: Higher interest rates attract more foreign investment, strengthening the
                            dollar.
                        </li>
                        <li>Economic Data: Positive indicators like GDP growth, employment rates, and consumer spending
                            can
                            bolster the dollar.</li>
                        <li>Geopolitical Stability: Political uncertainty may lead to a flight to safety, increasing
                            demand
                            for the dollar.</li>
                        <li>Trade Balance: A trade surplus tends to strengthen the dollar, while a deficit can weaken
                            it.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Inverse Relationship: The Dollar Index often has an inverse relationship with commodity
                            prices.
                            A stronger dollar can reduce demand and cause prices to fall.</li>
                        <li>Commodity Hedge: Commodities like gold often act as a hedge against a weakening dollar.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Inverse Correlation with Commodities: Commodities priced in dollars tend to have an inverse
                            relationship with the Dollar Index. When the dollar strengthens, commodity prices in dollar
                            terms may decrease.</li>
                        <li>Sensitivity of Commodities to Dollar Index:

                                <li>Gold: Strong inverse correlation with a weaker dollar often leading to increased

                                    prices.</li>
                                <li>Oil: Dollar Index strength impacts oil prices; a stronger dollar tends to lower oil
                                    prices for buyers using other currencies.</li>
                                <li>Other Commodities: Agricultural products and metals might exhibit some sensitivity
